# dbt_fivetran_log v0.6.2
## Fixes
- Extend model disablement with `config: is_enabled` setting in sources to avoid running source freshness when a model is disabled. ([#58](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/58))

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.6.1
## Fixes
- Added the option to disable the `user`, `account_membership`, and `destination_membership` models that may not be available depending on your Fivetran setup. In your `dbt_project.yml` you can now change these flags to disable parts of the package. Use the below to configure your project. ([#52](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/52)) and ([#55](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/55))

  ```yml
  fivetran_log_using_account_membership: false # Disables account membership models
  fivetran_log_using_destination_membership: false # Disables account membership models
  fivetran_log_using_user: false # Disables account membership models
  ```

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.6.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- This release includes updates to the `fivetran_log__credit_mar_destination_history` and `stg_fivetran_log__credits_used` models to account for the new Fivetran pricing model. These changes include: ([#50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/50))
  - `stg_fivetran_log__credits_used`
    - The field `credits_consumed` has been renamed to `credits_spent`
  - `fivetran_log__credit_mar_destination_history`
    - The model has been renamed to `fivetran_log__usage_mar_destination_history`
    - The field `credits_per_million_mar` has been renamed to `credits_spent_per_million_mar`
    - The field `mar_per_credit` has been renamed to `mar_per_credit_spent`

## ðŸŽ‰ Features ðŸŽ‰
- README documentation updates for easier experience leveraging the dbt package.
- Added `fivetran_log_[source_table_name]_identifier` variables to allow for easier flexibility of the package to refer to source tables with different names.
- This package now accounts for the new Fivetran pricing model. In particular, the new model accounts for the amount of dollars spend vs credits spent. Therefore, a new staging model `stg_fivetran_log__usage_cost` has been added. ([#50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/50))
  - This model relies on the `usage_cost` source table. If you do not have this source table it means you are not on the new pricing model yet. Please note, the dbt package will still generate this staging model. However, the model will be comprised of all `null` records.
- In addition to the new staging model, two new fields have been added to the `fivetran_log__usage_mar_destination_history` model. These fields mirror the credits spent fields, but account for the amount of dollars spent instead of credits. ([#50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/50))
  - `amount_spent_per_million_mar`
  - `mar_per_amount_spent`

## Under the Hood
- Introduces a new macro `does_table_exist` to be leveraged in the new pricing model updates. This macro will check the sources defined and provide either `true` or `false` if the table does or does not exist in the schema. ([#50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/50))

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.4
## Fixes
- The unique combination of columns test within the `fivetran_log__schema_changelog` model has been updated to also check the `message_data` field. This is needed as schema changelog events may now sync at the same time. ([#51](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/51))
- The `fivetran_log__connector_status` model has been adjusted to filter out all logs that contain a `transformation_id`. Transformation logs are not always synced as a JSON object and thus the package may encounter errors on Snowflake warehouses when parsing non-JSON fields. Since transformation records are not used in this end model, they have been filtered out. ([#51](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/51))

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.3
## Fixes
- Per the [Fivetran Log December 2021 Release Notes](https://fivetran.com/docs/logs/changelog#december2021) every sync results in a final `sync_end` event. In the previous version of this package, a successful sync was identified via a `sync_end` event while anything else was a version of broken. Since all syncs result in a `sync_end` event now, the package has been updated to account for this change within the connector.
- To account for the above fix, a new field (`last_successful_sync_completed_at`) was added to the `fivetran_log__connector_status` model. This field captures the last successful sync for the connector.
# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.2
## Fixes
- The `fivetran_log__connector_status` model uses a date function off of `created_at` from the `stg_fivetran_log__log` model. This fails on certain redshift destinations as the timestamp is synced as `timestamptz`. Therefore, the field within the staging model is cast using `dbt_utils.type_timestamp` to appropriately cast the field for downstream functions. Further, to future proof, timestamps were cast within the following staging models: `account`, `account_membership`, `active_volume`, `destination_membership`, `destination`, `log`, `transformation`, and `user`. ([#40](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/pull/40))
# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.1

## Features
This release just introduces Databricks compatibility! ðŸ§±ðŸ§±

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.0
ðŸŽ‰ Official dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility Release ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

## Additional Features
- Materializes the `fivetran_log__audit_table` incrementally, and employs partitioning for BigQuery users. As a non-incremental table, this model involved high runtimes for some users ([#27](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/issues/27))
  - If you would like to apply partitioning to the underlying source tables (ie the `LOG` table), refer to [Fivetran docs](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/bigquery/partition-table) on how to do so.
- Expands compatibility to Postgres!

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.0-b1

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.4.1

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes
- n/a

## Bug Fixes
- Added logic in the `fivetran_log__connector_status` model to accommodate the way [priority-first syncs](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/feature#priorityfirstsync) are currently logged. Now, each connector's `connector_health` field can be one of the following values:
    - "broken"
    - "incomplete"
    - "connected"
    - "paused"
    - "initial sync in progress"
    - "priority first sync"
Once your connector has completed its priority-first sync and begun syncing normally, it will be marked as `connected`.

## Features
- Added this changelog to capture iterations of the package!
