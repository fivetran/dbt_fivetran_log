# dbt_fivetran_log v0.5.0
🎉 Official dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility Release 🎉
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

## Additional Features
- Materializes the `fivetran_log__audit_table` incrementally, and employs partitioning for BigQuery users. As a non-incremental table, this model involved high runtimes for some users ([#27](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_log/issues/27))
  - If you would like to apply partitioning to the underlying source tables (ie the `LOG` table), refer to [Fivetran docs](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/bigquery/partition-table) on how to do so.
- Expands compatibility to Postgres!

# dbt_fivetran_log v0.4.1

## 🚨 Breaking Changes
- n/a

## Bug Fixes
- Added logic in the `fivetran_log__connector_status` model to accommodate the way [priority-first syncs](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/feature#priorityfirstsync) are currently logged. Now, each connector's `connector_health` field can be one of the following values:
    - "broken"
    - "incomplete"
    - "connected"
    - "paused"
    - "initial sync in progress"
    - "priority first sync"
Once your connector has completed its priority-first sync and begun syncing normally, it will be marked as `connected`.

## Features
